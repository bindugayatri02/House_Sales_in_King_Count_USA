# Real Estate Price Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. As a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust, the objective is to predict housing prices based on a given set of features or attributes. This analysis will help the Trust in making informed decisions about investing in residential real estate. The project utilizes a template notebook provided in the lab, and the task is to complete ten questions related to the data and price prediction.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project contains house sale prices for King County, including Seattle. It includes home sales data between May 2014 and May 2015. The dataset contains various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and others relevant to predicting house prices. The dataset was obtained and slightly modified for the purposes of this course. You can access the original data [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction].

## Objectives
- Analyze the provided dataset to understand the distribution and characteristics of the features.
- Explore the relationship between different features and the house prices.
- Develop and apply data analysis techniques to predict housing prices based on the given attributes.
- Display the obtained insights in the form of various plots using matplotlib function.
- Usage of various machine learning techniques like Simple Linear Regression, Model Selection, Prediction, Model Evaluation and Grid Search.
- Answer ten specific questions related to the dataset and price prediction using the template notebook.

## Tools Used
- JupyterLab (running on the Cloud in Skills Network Labs environment or a local machine)
- Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Data Output
The primary output of this project will be the completed template notebook containing the answers to the ten questions. This notebook includes code, visualizations, outputs and textual explanations based on the data analysis performed.

## Insights (Expected)
- Identification of key features that significantly influence housing prices in the King County area.
- Development of a model (as the goal is price prediction) to estimate house prices based on the available features.
- Answers to specific questions posed in the template notebook, providing data-driven insights into the housing market in the given region.

## Course Information
